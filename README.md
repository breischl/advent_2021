*** Advent of Code 2021 ***
My attempts at the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges. 

My goal is using these as exercises to continue learning Rust. So I don't expect to get on the leaderboards (especially because I'm starting a few days late).
I also plan to prioritize exploring Rust features, libraries and/or coding standards over other concerns.
